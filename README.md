#Fresh Tomatoes Movie Trailers

##About
This is my first project for Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nonodegree. The project involved writing server-side Python code for storing a list of movies and dynamically generating a static webpage that allows uses to browse the movies and to watch movie trailers.

Click [here](http://hackdev.github.io/Movie-Trailer-Website-/) to experience the live version of the page generated by this application. 

##How it works
This repo contains three modules:
- movie_data_structure -- this is a Python Class defining movie attributes and methods
- movie_catalog -- this module defines movie catalog and generates HTML file when run
- fresh_tomatoes -- this module contains HTML template, styles and scripting for the web page

##Steps to successfully run the application
1. Download and save the three modules
2. Run movie_catalog to generate HTML page
3. Click on movie poster to watch the trailer

You will need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run this application.
